Summary
In this session, you build a simple linear regression model in Python using the advertising dataset. You also saw some more theoretical aspects in between. Here's a brief of what you learnt in this session.

A quick recap of simple linear regression
Assumptions of simple linear regression
	Linear relationship between X and y.
	Normal distribution of error terms.
	Independence of error terms.
	Constant variance of error terms.
Hypothesis testing in linear regression
	To determine the significance of beta coefficients.

Building a linear model
	OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) method in statsmodels to fit a line.
Summary statistics
	F-statistic, r-squared, coefficients and their p-values.
Residual Analysis
	Histogram of the error terms to check normality.
	Plot of the error terms with X or y to check independence.
Predictions
	Making predictions on the test set using the 'predict()' function.
Linear Regression using SKLearn
	A second package apart from statsmodels for linear regression.
	A more hassle-free package to just fit a line without any inferences.
